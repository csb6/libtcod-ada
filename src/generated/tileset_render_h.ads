  --    Render a console to a SDL_Surface with a software renderer.
  --    `tileset` is the tiles to render with, must not be NULL.
  --    `console` is the console to render, must not be NULL.
  --    `cache` is an optional pointer to a consoled used as a cache.  The console
  --    at `*cache` will be created or modified.  The `cache` will be used to skip
  --    drawing already drawn tiles on any subsequent calls.
  --    `surface_out` is a pointer to where to put the surface will be managed.
  --    The surface at `*surface_out` will be created or modified and will change
  --    to match the size of `console` and `tileset`.  The pixel format will be
  --    SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA32.
  --    Returns a negative value on error, see `TCOD_get_error`.
